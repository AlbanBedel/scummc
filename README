                        A Scumm Compiler


I. What is ScummC ?

 The aim of this project is to create a full set of tools making
 it possible to write scumm games from scratch. As I'm not too crazy
 I'm targeting a single version of the engine, the version 6 used in
 Day of the Tentacle. Support of upper version is planned but for
 much later.


II. This release

 This release mark a new important milestone: it is finnaly possible
 to create a 100% free Scumm game.

 In this release you will find:

  * scc      : the compiler
  * sld      : the linker
  * boxedit  : a room box editor
  * cost     : a costume compiler
  * char     : a charset converter
  * costview : a costume viewer/editor prototype
  * soun     : a simple soun ressources builder
  * midi     : a tool to hack MIDI files

 Some utilities that might (or might not) be useful with scumm related
 hacking.

  * zpnn2bmp : convert ZPnn blocks to bmp
  * imgsplit : split a bmp (it conserve the palette)
  * imgremap : exchange two colors (both palette and data)
  * palcat   : combine bmp palettes.
  * raw2voc  : read some raw 8bit unsigned samples and pack them in a voc.
  * scvm     : a VM prototype that should become a debugger some day.

III. Compiling it

 Requirements:
 
  * GNU make >= 3.80
  * bison (minimal version between 1.28 and 1.35)
  * GTK >= 2.4 (for boxedit and costview)

 Optional libraries:

  * Freetype (to build charsets from ttf fonts)
  * SDL (for scvm)

 To compile just run configure and then make (or gmake). If you want to
 also compile the extra utilities run make all. To see all available
 targets run make help.

 Only GNU/Linux i386 is fully tested, however thanks to sourceforge's
 compile farm the compiler is know to work (not just compile) on the
 followings platform:

  * GNU/Linux   i386 amd64 alpha openpower
  * NetBSD      i386
  * FreeBSD     i386
  * OpenBSD     i386
  * Solaris     i386 sparc
  * OSX         ppc

 Platform known to be able to compile (most probably work just fine):

  * Mingw       i386 (cross compiled)

 Platform that used to be able to compile but haven't been tested recently:
 
  * Cygwin      i386


IV. What can i do with that ?

 Already quiet a lot ;) A complete game can be build from scratch, even
 with voices. The biggest missing thing is the music as their is no support
 for imuse. A few other minor things might still be missing.


V. Getting started

 An example is provided. Just cd into one of the example directory and
 run make. If all went well it should produce 3 files: scummc.000,
 scummc.001 and scummc.sou.

 To run ScummC games with ScummVM their is two ways. The recommended
 way is to patch ScummVM to have it recognize ScummC games and run them
 without any game specific hack. Otherwise you can run the game as Day
 of the tentacle, this is not recommended because a few hacks might
 kick in. However that shouldn't be a problem with small test games.
 
 To patch ScummVM cd in your ScummVM source directory and run:
 patch -p1 < ~/scummc-X.X/patches/scummvm-Y.Y.Y-scummc.diff
 
 Alternatively you can use the original LEC interpreter, but be warned
 that a few things (namely save/load) are currently not working with it.
 Not that you really need to save in the example game ;)
 
 Note that to run the game as Day of the Tentacle with ScummVM or with the
 LEC interpreter you must give the following extra options to sld:
 -o tentacle -key 0x69. For the LEC interpreter you must also rename
 tentacle.sou to monster.sou.

 Documentation is currently limited, the two most useful sources are:

  * http://alban.dotsec.net/Projects/ScummC

    The home of this project, for all ScummC specific documentation
    and some technical stuff about scumm internals.

  * http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCUMM_Technical_Reference

    More techinal documentation. If you are new to scumm you should at least
    read http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/SCUMM_Virtual_Machine which give
    a nice overview of the VM.


VI. The box editor

 This tool allow you to define the boxes in your room in a graphical
 manner and to name them for easy reffering in the scripts.
 Be warned that the interface is perhaps a bit unusual. The 2 open and save
 buttons should be self-explicit. But both have an alternative action if
 clicked with a shift key pressed. Namely open a background image and
 save as. On the view you have following actions:

  left button        : add point to the selection
  right button       : remove point from the selection

  shift+left button  : add box to the selection
  shift+right button : remove box from the selection

  ctrl+left button   : select other point (a point need to be selected first)
  ctrl+right button  : select other box (a box need to be selected first)

  left button drag   : move the selection
  middle button drag : move the view

  Their is also the following keys:

  b         : create a new box
  d/suppr   : delete the selection
  esc       : clear selection
  u/q       : undo
  r/o       : redo
  >/+       : zoom in
  </-       : zoom out
  s         : save
  S         : save as

 I'm using a Dvorak layout so the o/q are well placed, i put u/r as
 alternative because they are easy to remember. However i would be glad
 to add some qzerty friendly bindings.

 On the command line you can specify a box filename and/or a background image
 with the -img parameter.


VII. Warning and other legal stuff

 Be warned this is very beta, a lot of features are missing. Use at your
 own risk. All the code has been written by myself and is under GPL.
 Some bit of code have been stolen (ie. copy/pasted and c-ifier) from scummvm.
 I don't have time for legal stuff at the moment so just play fair ;)


VIII. Thanks

 Big thanks to all scummvm coders and contributors. All this would
 have never been possible without you !!!!

 Big thanks to David Given, http://www.cowlark.com/scumm was a very
 useful source.

 Big thanks to sourceforge.net for the compile farm that allowed making
 this software portable on 10 different platforms.

 Thanks to the few people how at least tried to compile and perhaps even
 used a bit one of these early versions.

 are always welcome.
