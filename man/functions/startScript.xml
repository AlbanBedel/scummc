	    The 2 first bits of flags are used: bit 0 mean freeze resistant, and bit 1
	    recursive. Freeze resistant mean that the script won't be freezed by
	    "normal" freezeUnfreeze() calls. If recursive is not set, then any running
	    instance of the script is stopped before the script is started.
