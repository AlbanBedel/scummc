<man name="isObjectOfClass" long-name="">
	<description>	
	
	
	Check if an object match the given class combination. If the class number
	is ored with 0x80 then the object must belong to the class, otherwise it
	musn't belong to it. For ex isObjectOfClass(obj,[ Openable + 128, Pickable])
	will return 1 if the object is Openable and not Pickable. Note that we
	use + here because the LEC interpreter doesn't support bitwise or.
	As classes number only range up to 32 using + is ok anyway.
